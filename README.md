# Titanic-Dataset-Analysis:

 Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification. In the context of the Titanic dataset, it can help predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, class, etc. Here's a brief outline of the process:

Data Preparation:

Load the Titanic dataset.
Handle missing values by either filling them in or removing rows/columns with missing data.
Convert categorical variables (like 'Sex' and 'Embarked') into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Split the data into features (X) and target (y), where the target is whether the passenger survived.

Train-Test Split:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Model Training:
Fit a logistic regression model to the training data. This involves finding the best-fitting parameters to predict the binary outcome (survived or not).

Model Evaluation:
Use the testing set to evaluate the model's performance.
Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.

Interpretation:
Analyze the coefficients of the logistic regression model to understand the impact of different features on the likelihood of survival.
